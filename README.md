This repository is made for the flask web application that can be used by the client through the 'Deploy' feature of Auto-DL with which the DL Models can be hosted locally.

## How to run 
The flask web app will be integrated and used as a feature of 'Auto-DL' and is not to be run independently. 

## How it's used in Auto-DL's main repo
The flask web app will be integrated in the main application. When the user downloads the code he can choose to host the DL model locally with the 'Deploy' feature where this flask web app will be used.

#### Features/Enhancements Planned
1. The application currently supports classification models so it needs to be generalized to have regression models as well.
